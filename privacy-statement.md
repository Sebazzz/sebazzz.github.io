This blog is a [hobby of mine](/about). I do not have any interest in collecting personal data of the visitors of this blog. I will never do this.

But perhaps you like to comment on one of the articles I wrote. In that case you will provide some personal data to the comment service I use, Disqus. Therefore it is important to read this privacy statement.
