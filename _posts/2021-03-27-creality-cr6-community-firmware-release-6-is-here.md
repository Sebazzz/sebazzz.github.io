After months of work a new stable release of the Creality CR-6 Community Firmware is here! Release 6 is titled the "Tune it, love it" release, due to the many more controls available to improve and maintain print quality. This includes various calibration methods, like e-step and PID tuning from the touch screen, manual bed leveling, and motion settings.
