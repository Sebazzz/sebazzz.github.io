There are far too few reviews of 3d printer filament. For this reason I'm starting a series of quick filament reviews: short filament reviews, some remarks, some findings, and whether I'd buy it again. For this third installment: [3DJAKE ecoPLA red](https://www.3djake.nl/3djake/ecopla-rood).

## 3DJAKE filaments

The 3d printing related webshop [3DJAKE](https://www.3djake.com/) is an international webshop and they have their own filament brand. It is unclear to me if they extrude and produce it themselves or if they put their own brand on a white label spool.

## Packaging and spool

The filament comes in a non-reusable friendly polystyrene spool. I purchased the 250g variant.

The spool itself is quite basic and not reusable. It should be recyclable though. The spool of filament is shrinkwrapped, but not vacuum.

## Printing

This filament features a very vibrant red color. It really screams *RED* when you have objects printed in it.

*This filament change bottle cap [printed on the Anet ET4 Pro](/blog/2020/11/30/anet-et4-pro-review) came out pretty good*

*Printing parts for my Creality CR-6 SE printer*

On this print I noticed some slight warping of the parts. I haven't seen this with other standard PLA filaments (except [BASICFIL Blue](/blog/2021/01/31/quick-filament-review-basicfil-pla-blue)) on this build surface.

*A part with supports - this time using 3dlac for adhesion. The support came of very easily.*

The final print is a vase printed with a 0.8mm nozzle at 1.6mm wall width.

## Pro's / cons

Pro's:

- No stringing
- Very vibrant color
- Easy to use

Cons:

- Slight tendency to warp
- Spool is not reusable and ends up in the trash
- Small spools are quite expensive (unit price is double of a 1kg spool)


## Would I buy this again?

I might buy this again. I do think that there are cheaper filaments available - but this filament isn't too expensive (about â‚¬22).
