In the [previous post](2016-06-07-ordered-tests-with-nunit-mstest-xunit-pt1-nunit) we looked briefly at ordered testing in MSTest. Today we are going to implement ordered tests in NUnit. The code for this post can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sebazzz/NetUnitTestComparison/tree/2016-06-05). **Disclaimer:** This code will have rough edges, and may not work for you, kill you cat or blow up in your face.
