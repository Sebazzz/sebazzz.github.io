There are far too few reviews of 3d printer filament. For this reason I'm starting a series of quick filament reviews: short filament reviews, some remarks, some findings, and whether I'd buy it again. For this first installment: [Prusament PLA Azure Blue](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/prusament/716-prusament-pla-azure-blue-1kg.html).

## Prusament

[Prusament](https://prusament.com/) is the high-quality filament line of [Prusa Research](https://www.prusa3d.com/) - of course known from their 3d printers. The filament is produced in the Czech Republic (Europe).

## Packaging and spool

Prusament comes in a cardboard box with a QR code on it. That QR code links to the Prusament website, where you can track the production of your particular roll of filament. My roll has [ID 124c87b9 and can be tracked here](https://prusament.com/spool/?spoolId=124c87b9).

*The cardboard box. The filament is inside, sealed in a vacuum bag.*

The spool itself has quite a smart design. The hexagon pattern at the sides allow you to lock the filament at any position when done printing. A pretty smart design. It also saves some plastic - which is necessary because these spools are unfortunately not reusable (it is not [a master spool](https://www.matterhackers.com/articles/tech-breakdown-the-master-spool)).

Prusa did use a cardboard center in the spool - but that makes only a small part of it recyclable - but it does not make the spool _reusable_.

## Printing

At first glance the filament looks pretty good, but for anything other than vases I experienced an pretty inconsistent color. This is regardless of temperature or print speed. The color was not consistent.

*A regular vase printed in vase mode looks pretty good*

*This is a vase, but not in vase mode (2mm thick wall). Some faces show an inconsistent color.*

I also noticed that this filament is not usable for ironing. It just makes the colors even worse.

*Different ironing settings, including the center without ironing*

## Pro's / cons

Pro's:

- Beautiful color for vases
- No stringing

Cons:

- Ironing doesn't work on this filament
- Color is inconsistent

## Would I buy this again?

No - I would not buy this again. Perhaps this inconsistent color is a "feature" and not a problem - but it isn't a feature I like.
